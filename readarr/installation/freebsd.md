# Announcement: Retirement of Readarr

We would like to announce that the [Readarr project](https://github.com/Readarr/Readarr) has been retired. This difficult decision was made due to a combination of factors: the project's metadata has become unusable, we no longer have the time to remake or repair it, and the community effort to transition to using Open Library as the source has stalled without much progress.

Third-party metadata mirrors exist, but as we're not involved with them at all, we cannot provide support for them. Use of them is entirely at your own risk. The most popular mirror appears to be [rreading-glasses](https://github.com/blampe/rreading-glasses).

Without anyone to take over Readarr development, we expect it to wither away, so we still encourage you to seek alternatives to Readarr.

## Key Points

- Effective Immediately: The retirement takes effect immediately. Please stay tuned for any possible further communications.
- Support Window: We will provide support during a brief transition period to help with troubleshooting non metadata related issues.
- Alternative Solutions: Users are encouraged to explore and adopt any other possible solutions as alternatives to Readarr.
- Opportunities for Revival: We are open to someone taking over and revitalizing the project. If you are interested, please get in touch.
- Gratitude: We extend our deepest gratitude to all the contributors and community members who supported Readarr over the years.

Thank you for being part of the Readarr journey. For any inquiries or assistance during this transition, please contact our team.

Sincerely,
The Servarr Team

## Jail Setup Using TrueNAS GUI

1. From the main screen select Jails

1. Click ADD

1. Click Advanced Jail Creation

1. Name (any name will work): Readarr

1. Jail Type: Default (Clone Jail)

1. Release: 12.2-Release (or newer)

1. Configure Basic Properties to your liking

1. Configure Jail Properties to your liking but add

- [x] allow_mlock

- [x] allow_raw_sockets

> `allow_raw_sockets` is helpful for troubleshooting (e.g. ping, traceroute) but is not a requirement. {.is-info}

1. Configure Network Properties to your liking

1. Configure Custom Properties to your liking

1. Click Save

1. After the jail is created it will start automatically. One more property is required to be set in order for Readarr to see the storage space of your mounted media locations. Open a root shell on the server and enter these commands:

```shell
iocage stop <jailname>
iocage set enforce_statfs=1 <jailname>
iocage start <jailname>
```

## Readarr Installation

Back on the jails list find your newly created jail for `readarr` and click "Shell"

To install Readarr

> \* Ensure your pkg repo is configured to get packages from `/latest` and not `/quarterly`
> \* Check `/usr/local/etc/pkg/repos/FreeBSD.conf`
> \* If that does not exist, copy over `/etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf` to that location, open it, and replace `quarterly` with `latest`
{.is-warning}

```shell
pkg install readarr
```

Don't close the shell out yet we still have a few more things!

## Configuring Readarr

Now that we have it installed a few more steps are required.

### Service Setup

Time to enable the service but before we do, a note:

The updater is disabled by default. The `pkg-message` gives instructions on how to enable the updater but keep in mind: this can break things like `pkg check -s` and `pkg remove` for Readarr when the built-in updater replaces files.

To enable the service:

```shell
sysrc readarr_enable=TRUE
```

If you do not want to use user/group `readarr` you will need to tell the service file what user/group it should be running under

```shell
sysrc readarr_user="USER_YOU_WANT"
```

```shell
sysrc readarr_group="GROUP_YOU_WANT"
```

`readarr` stores its data, config, logs, and PID files in `/usr/local/readarr` by default. The service file will create this and take ownership of it IF AND ONLY IF IT DOES NOT EXIST. If you want to store these files in a different place (e.g., a dataset mounted into the jail for easier snapshots) then you will need to change it using `sysrc`

```shell
sysrc readarr_data_dir="DIR_YOU_WANT"
```

Reminder: If you are using an existing location then you will manually need to either: change the ownership to the UID/GID `readarr` uses AND/OR add `readarr` to a GID that has write access.

Almost done, let's start the service:

```shell
service readarr start
```

If everything went according to plan then readarr should be up and running on the IP of the jail (port 8787)!

You can now safely close the shell

## Troubleshooting

- The service appears to be running but the UI is not loading or the page is timing out
  - Double check that `allow_mlock` is enabled in the jail
  
- `System.NET.Sockets.SocketException (43): Protocol not supported`
  - Make sure you have `VNET` turned on for your jail, ip6=inherit, or ip6=new

> The service script should now work around the lack of VNET and/or IP6 thus removing the requirement for VNET or ip6=inherit
